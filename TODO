MAJOR
- haven't figured out how to get rspec working yet

MINOR
- don't hardcode 'users' as the 'users' table in the application - make it configurable

- self.table_name shouldn't be necessary in the models

- VisitEventView shouldn't need set_primary_key "id"
  found that the postgres adapter needed it, otherwise find_each breaks
