MAJOR
- haven't figured out how to get rspec working yet

MODERATE
- cache:
  - Visit::Event.url
  - Visit::Manage.create_visit_traits_batch
  - Visit::Arrival.create_delegate
  - I reckon redis LRU is the way to go

MINOR
- don't hardcode 'users' as the 'users' table in the application - make it configurable

- VisitEventView shouldn't need set_primary_key "id"
  found that the postgres adapter needed it, otherwise find_each breaks
