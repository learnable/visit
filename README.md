visit
=====

Record visits to a site so that they're easy to analyse afterward

Visit assumes there is a table 'users' existing in the database.

Via <code>psql</code>
```psql
CREATE USER visit CREATEDB;
```

Then:

cd spec/dummy
bundle exec rake db:create

RACK_ENV=test bundle exec rake db:migrate
```
